            Hello! My Name is Bikramaditya Mandal. I am a Postdoctoral Researcher working with Prof. Balakrishnan Naduvalath at University of Nevada Las Vegas (UNLV). 
            My research at UNLV is primarily focused on <strong>quantum control of cold and ultracold scattering of inelastic collisions and reactions</strong>. Additionally, 
            I am incorporating <strong>machine learning</strong> algorithms into my research to build databases of rate-coefficients to be used for astronomical modelling of 
            atmospheres of exoplanets, interstellar medium (ISM), and comets. Please go to my <a href="research.html" target="_blank">Research Section</a> to know more details about 
            my current and previous research projects.
        </p>

        <p><strong><span style="color: blue;">First Postdoctoral Research Experience (May 2021 - December 2022)</span></strong></p>
        <p style="text-indent: 4em;">
            Prior to my tenure at UNLV, I worked as a Postdoctoral Researcher with Prof. Dmitri Babikov at Marquette University. My primary 
            research was to develop mixed quantum/classical theory (MQCT) to study inelastic scateering of molecules. A more detailed description of my projects during that
            period is provided in the <a href="research.html" target="_blank">Research Section</a>.

        <p><strong><span style="color: blue;">Education</span></strong></p>
        <p style="text-indent: 4em;">
            I completed my undergraduate degree B.Sc. in Chemistry (Hons.) from Visva-Bharati University, Santiniketan, West Bengal, India in the year 2013. Following that, 
            I completed my master's degree (M.Sc.) from Visva-Bharati University in 2015. After that, I obtained my Ph.D. from Marquette University, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, 
            USA in May 2021. I received Denis J. O'Brien Summer Scholarship in 2019 and <a href="https://www.marquette.edu/chemistry/graduate-awards.php" target="_blank">Dr. John J. Eisch Fellowship</a> 
            for academic year 2020-2021 for my research excellence. I also received <a href="https://theaic.org/award_winners/student_awards2021.html" target="_blank">American Institute of Chemists (AIC)</a>
            award for my Ph.D. Thesis in 2021.
