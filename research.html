                        Quantum control of chemical reactions and inelastic scattering of molecules remain at the forefront of modern 
                        theoretical and computational chemistry. Quantum control can be achieved through quantum interference effects 
                        or quantum state preparations of molecular states, e.g., controlling alignment or orientations of the reactant 
                        molecules, generally referred to as stereodynamics. These effects are amplified at low temperatures where quantum effects dominate.

                        Recent advances in molecular cooling and trapping technologies have also led to renewed interest in inelastic 
                        and reactive collisions of atom-molecule and molecule-molecule systems. Indeed, collisions of cold and ultracold 
                        diatomic molecules are an active area of experimental and theoretical research due to their applications to 
                        quantum sensing, ultracold chemistry, quantum computing, and quantum information processing. Although, diatomic species 
                        such as CaF, SrF, RbCs, KRb, NaK, etc. are preferred molecules for such applications, their small rotational constants 
                        lead to high densities of states making rigorous quantum calculations of diatom-diatom collisions involving these 
                        molecules computationally intractable. Therefore, lighter diatomic molecules, such as H<sub>2</sub> and its 
                        isotopologues, are generally preferred to benchmark theoretical studies against experiments. These systems are 
                        characterized by large rotational constants and low densities of states, thus requiring only a small number of 
                        orbital angular momentum partial waves to yield converged cross sections in the micro-kelvin (ultracold) range of 
                        collision energies.

                        <strong>Prof. Richard N. Zare</strong> and his reseach group at the <strong>Stanford University</strong> have 
                        recently developed a coherent optical technique, called Stark-induced adiabatic Raman passage (SARP), to study 
                        quantum controlled cold collisions of light molecular systems, such as H<sub>2</sub>, HD and D<sub>2</sub>. 
                        The SARP technique allows preparation of a phase-coherent superposition of degenerate alligned states 
                        (<em>m</em><sub><em>j</em></sub>) within a single ro-vibrational state. Additionally, the colliding partners are 
                        adiabatically expanded and co-propagated in the same molecular beam, yielding relative collision energies in 
                        the 1 kelvin regime for collisions involving H<sub>2</sub> and its isotopologues. This provides a powerful 
                        approach to probe stereodynamics in collision of quantum state-prepared and aligned molecules. 
                        In recent years, they have advanced the experimental research in this area by exploring quantum-controlled 
                        collisions of light molecular systems employing the SARP technique. While the initial experiments focused on 
                        state-prepared HD colliding with unprepared H<sub>2</sub> and D<sub>2</sub>, subsequent studies investigated 
                        simpler atom-diatom collisions, such as HD + He, D<sub>2</sub> + He, and D<sub>2</sub> + Ne, which allow 
                        simplified interpretation and analysis of experimental data as collisions are often dominated by isolated partial 
                        waves in the 1-10 K regime. Recently, SARP experiments on collisions of two aligned D<sub>2</sub> molecules 
                        prepared in the <em>v</em> = 2, <em>j</em>= 2 initial state were reported that measured four-vector correlations 
                        in bimolecular collisions. SARP experiments have also been reported for the chemical reaction by another research 
                        group between aligned HD(<em>v</em> = 1, <em>j</em>= 2) and H leading to the D+H<sub>2</sub> product using crossed 
                        molecular beams.

                                The goal of this work is to carry out a rigorous theoretical investigation of rotational quenching of HD 
                                and D<sub>2</sub> by collisions with He for vibrational levels <em>v</em> = 2 and <em>v</em> = 4 and 
                                rotational levels <em>j</em> = 2 and <em>j</em> = 4 of the two molecules. Prior studies of He + HD for 
                                <em>v</em> =1 and He + D<sub>2</sub> for <em>v</em> = 2 employed the BSP3 potential energy surface (PES) 
                                for the He-H<sub>2</sub> system. This potential is computed at the coupled-cluster level with single, 
                                double, and perturbative triple excitations [CCSD(T)] augmented with corrections for higher-order 
                                excitations up to the full configuration interaction (FCI) level and the diagonal Born-Oppenheimer 
                                correction (DBOC). However, the DBOC corrections were computed for the most abundant He-H2 isotopologue. 
                                Here, we eliminated this minor deficiency of the potential by constructing separate mass-dependent DBOC 
                                corrections for the He-HD and He-D<sub>2</sub> systems to arrive at the optimal interaction potentials for 
                                the specific isotopic variants. While these DBOC corrected potentials yield almost identical results as 
                                the original BSP3 surface, they remove one perceived source of uncertainty in the ab initio interaction 
                                potentials adopted in the scattering calculations.

                                In this work, we primarily focus on rotational quenching from <em>j</em> = 2 &rarr; <em>j'</em> = 0 and 
                                <em>j</em> = 2 &rarr; <em>j'</em> = 1 in <em>v</em> = 2, <em>j</em> = 2 &rarr; <em>j'</em> = 1 and 
                                <em>j</em> = 4 &rarr; <em>j'</em> = 3 in <em>v</em> = 4 for HD, and <em>j</em> = 4 &rarr; <em>j'</em> = 2
                                and <em>j</em> = 2 &rarr; <em>j'</em> = 0 in <em>v</em> = 4 for D<sub>2</sub>, induced by collisions 
                                with He in the cold energy regime. These initial states of HD and D<sub>2</sub> were the focus of recent 
                                SARP experiments by the research group of <strong>Prof. Richard N. Zare</strong> at the <strong>Stanford University</strong>.

                                A comparison between the experimental H-SARP angular distribution and our theoretical results for rotational 
                                quenching in HD (<em>v</em> = 2, <em>j</em> = 2)+ He collisions is also done. We also compared the experimental
                                data for the same rotational transition (&Delta;<em>j</em> = -2) in <em>v</em> = 2 with our theoretical results. The comparison is 
                                favorable for both &Delta;<em>j</em> = -2 and &Delta;<em>j</em> = -1 transitions for forward and backward scattering
                                angles. However, there is a strong discrepancy between experiment and theory for the &Delta;<em>j</em> = -2 
                                transition (<em>v</em> = 2) near the central peak, for which the sideways peak in the experimental result is nearly 
                                as intense as the forward and backward scattering peaks while the theory results show a dip with a flat DCS. 
                                Interestingly, the sideways peak is not observed in H-SARP experiments for HD(<em>v</em> = 1), and there is indeed 
                                a good agreement between our calculations and <em>v</em> = 1 experiments. According to our calculations, both the 
                                position and the relative intensity of the <em>l</em> = 1 resonance are largely independent of the vibrational 
                                state of HD. This, together with the experimental velocity distribution (which is similar for <em>v</em> = 1 and <em>v</em> = 2), leads 
                                us to the prediction that similar experimental angular distributions should be obtained for <em>v</em> = 1 and 
                                <em>v</em> = 2 (as it happens in our calculations). Hence, the better agreement between our calculations and the 
                                <em>v</em> = 1 H-SARP experiments is not surprising but the differences in the sideways region between <em>v</em> = 1
                                and <em>v</em> = 2 H-SARP experimental angular distribution indicate inconsistency between the experimental measurements.

                                Resonant scattering of highly vibrationally excited and aligned D<sub>2</sub> in cold collisions with Ne 
                                has recently been probed experimentally using the Stark-induced adiabatic Raman passage (SARP) technique 
                                by the research group of <strong>Prof. Richard N. Zare</strong>. A partial-wave analysis and numerical fitting 
                                of the experimental data attributed the measured angular distribution to an <em>l</em> = 2 shape resonance 
                                near 1 kelvin. Here, we report computation of a new potential energy surface for the Ne-H<sub>2</sub> 
                                interaction suitable for the study of collisions between highly vibrationally excited H<sub>2</sub> and 
                                D<sub>2</sub> with Ne as well as quantum scattering calculations of stereodynamics of 
                                D<sub>2</sub>(<em>v</em> = 4, <em>j</em> = 2) + Ne collisions probing &Delta;<em>j</em> = -2 rotational 
                                transition in D<sub>2</sub>.

                                First, we compare our results with available experimental results obtained at thermal collision energies 
                                using crossed molecular beams. Unfortunately, very limited data exist for H<sub>2</sub>, D<sub>2</sub> 
                                and HD in collision with Ne and the available experimental results correspond to the work of 
                                Andres et al., Buck et al., Gerber et al., and Faubel et al. from nearly four decades ago. The 
                                measurements were carried out at collision energies of <em>E<sub>c</sub></em> = 765.9, 691.2 and 254.1 
                                cm<sup>-1</sup> for H<sub>2</sub>, D<sub>2</sub> and HD, respectively. The agreement between the two 
                                results is excellent for all H<sub>2</sub> isotopologues in the entire range of scattering angle despite 
                                the large variation in the magnitude of the DCS for the different state-to-state transitions. It is 
                                striking to see the oscillatory behavior of the DCS arising from interference between different partial 
                                wave contributions quantitatively reproduced by our calculations for HD + Ne collisions. The experimental 
                                values are reproduced as given in the relevant references quoted above and no scale factor is applied. 
                                The DCSs for the elastic transition, <em>j</em> = 0 &rarr;<em>j'</em> = 0 and the dominant inelastic 
                                transition, namely <em>j</em> = 0 &rarr;<em>j'</em> = 2 for both H<sub>2</sub> and D<sub>2</sub> are also 
                                accurately reproduced. Slight differences seen for the weaker <em>j</em> = 1 &rarr;<em>j'</em> = 3 
                                transition can be attributed to the mild anisotropy of the PES as explained in earlier works by Lique and 
                                Faubel et al. However, even for this weaker transition, our results are in good qualitative agreement 
                                with experiment.

                                Our main goal of this project is to compare against the SARP experiments by the research group of 
                                <strong>Prof. Richard N. Zare</strong> for rotational quenching of <em>j</em> = 2 &rarr;<em>j'</em> = 0
                                in <em>v</em> = 4 of D<sub>2</sub>. As such, cross sections for pure rotational transitions are orders 
                                of magnitude larger than ro-vibrational transitions for weakly interacting systems such as rare-gas 
                                H<sub>2</sub>. When we inventigated the ICS for this transition as a function of the collision energy, 
                                a strong resonance was found at ~2 cm<sup>-1</sup> with a peak cross section value of about ~20 
                                &#8491;<sup>2</sup>. A secondary resonance feature occurs at an energy of ~5 cm<sup>-1</sup> with a 
                                cross section of about ~2 &#8491;<sup>2</sup>, about an order of magnitude smaller compared to the primary 
                                peak. A partial-wave analysis of the ICS is done as well. It is found that the primary peak is due to an 
                                <em>l</em> = 5 resonance originating from total angular momentum <strong><em>J</em></strong> = 
                                <em>l'</em> = 3, 5, and 7.

                                from all relevant partial waves (both even and odd) in the energy-resolved DCS for both the H-SARP and
                                X-SARP preparation for the <em>j</em> = 2 &rarr;<em>j'</em> = 0 transition. The comparison is reasonable 
                                for both the H-SARP and X-SARP preparations. However, the rates around the central peak in the experimental 
                                and theoretical results are largely out-of-phase, compared to the forward and backward scattering peaks. 
                                It should be noted that for small relative collision energies the transverse velocity, perpendicular to 
                                the beam propagation, can be significant so that the angle of the actual relative velocity with respect to 
                                the pump and Stokes polarizations, &beta; , is no longer the nominal one, &beta; = 0<sup>o</sup> for 
                                H-SARP, or &beta; = 90<sup>o</sup> for V-SARP.

                                In this work, we performed full-dimensional quantum calculations of stereodynamic control of 
                                HD(<em>v</em> = 1, <em>j</em> = 2) + D<sub>2</sub> collisions for the first time that has been probed 
                                experimentally by <strong>Prof. Richard N. Zare</strong> and his reseach group at the 
                                <strong>Stanford University</strong> using the Stark-induced adiabatic Raman passage (SARP) technique.
                                It is found that the dominant inelastic channel in the rotational quenching of HD from 
                                <em>v</em><sub>HD</sub> = 1; <em>j</em><sub>HD</sub> = 2 &rarr; <em>v'</em><sub>HD</sub> = 1; 
                                <em>j'</em><sub>HD</sub> = 0 involves an energy transfer to D<sub>2</sub> leading to 
                                <em>j</em><sub>D<sub>2</sub></sub> = 0 &rarr; <em>j'</em><sub>D<sub>2</sub></sub> = 2 
                                rotational excitation of the D<sub>2</sub> molecule. This transition conserves the total molecular 
                                rotational angular momentum and has a cross section that is four times larger than that of direct 
                                relaxation of HD without D<sub>2</sub> rotational excitation.

                                The agreement 
                                is less satisfactory with recent SARP experiments that report stereodynamic control of rotational 
                                quenching in HD(<em>v</em><sub>HD</sub> = 1, <em>j</em><sub>HD</sub> = 2) + D<sub>2</sub> collisions. 
                                While our results generally agree with experiments for the <em>j</em><sub>HD</sub> = 2 &rarr;
                                <em>j'</em><sub>HD</sub> = 1 transition, a significant discrepancy is observed for the 
                                <em>j</em><sub>HD</sub> = 2 &rarr; <em>j'</em><sub>HD</sub> = 0 transition in HD. The 
                                discrepancy persists regardless of whether D<sub>2</sub> rotational excitation channel is considered 
                                in the theoretical simulations. We believe, a re-analysis of the experimental data including the 
                                D<sub>2</sub> rotational excitation channel in D<sub>2</sub>(<em>j</em> = 0) collisions or measurements

                        One of the major interests of astronomers is to observe different bodies in our solar system. Several 
                        state-of-the-art observatories, like Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) radio telescope, and other 
                        space-exploration telescopes, such as the Spitzer space telescope and, most recently, the James Webb space 
                        telescope (JWST), have been deployed to obtain data. Some of the recorded data are already available, and more 
                        will become available in the upcoming years. To understand and correlate with the observed rotational spectra 
                        obtained by ALMA or JWST missions, we need modeling with radiation transfer codes, such as RADEX, LIME, or MOLPOP, 
                        which in turn requires state-to-state collisional rate coefficients as input for the rotational 
                        excitation and quenching processes because the observed spectra is a result of these collisional processes between 
                        different molecules in a cometary coma. These rate coefficients are rather hard to derive compared to radiative 
                        decay coefficients, and thus, primarily unavailable, particularly for complex systems like 
                        H<sub>2</sub>O + H<sub>2</sub>O and HDO + H2O. In addition to these, some of the much needed rate coefficients of 
                        the inelastic collisions for the astronomical modeling include CH<sub>3</sub>OH + CO, H<sub>2</sub>O + HCN, 
                        H<sub>2</sub>CO + CO, H<sub>2</sub>O + CH<sub>3</sub>OH.

                    <p style="text-indent: 4em;">
                        Databases like BASECOL and LAMDA have been developed for astronomers to simplify this process of obtaining 
                        rate coefficients of different collisions. These databases are being populated by many scientists every day to 
                        supply collisional rate coefficients for modeling the radiation transfer processes. These rate coefficients 
                        can be computed by quantum mechanical treatment of the internal molecular states and implemented in a few 
                        codes available in the scientific community, such as MOLSCAT, HIBRIDON, TwoBC and more recently, MQCT.

                        Even though, MQCT can run simulations of collision of complex molecules, such as two asymetric-top-rotors like
                        H<sub>2</sub>O + H<sub>2</sub>O, the computational complexity remains challenging. As elaborated by my research 
                        during my Ph.D. and Postdoctoral tenure at Marquette Univeristy, the computation of these databases for 
                        H<sub>2</sub>O + H<sub>2</sub>O collisions required to compute four large matrices containing state-to-state 
                        transition elements, and then the simulation of mixed quantum/classical trajectoris. Computation of each of these 
                        matrices took about 676 thousand CPU hours. Additionally, the total cost of the scattering calculations 
                        (trajectory simulations) for six collision energies was about 5.25 million CPU hours. Altogether, the cost of 
                        the MQCT calculations of H<sub>2</sub>O + H<sub>2</sub>O collisions was nearly 8 millions CPU hours. More 
                        importantly, several months of human efforts were needed to put into running new calculations, monitor the ongoing 
                        simulations, to check results for completed runs, and finally numerous post processing analysis to convert from 
                        individual state-to-stare transitions cross sections computed by MQCT code to the rate-coefficients to be deposited 
                        to the databases as a end result.

                        Our research employs a machine-learning model to compute more rate-coefficients for complex collisions, such as 
                        H<sub>2</sub>O + H<sub>2</sub>O using the existing computed data. In this work, we propose a methodology that 
                        exploits the physical nature of the cross sections or rate coefficients data to train and build a 
                        multi-layer perceptron (MLP) model using neural-network. This methodology is expected to be computationally 
                        faster than the acutal quantum scattering calculations on average by orders of magnitude. At the same time, the
                        proposed workflow is robust, and general enough to apply for other important molecular collisions, like 
                        H<sub>2</sub>O + HDO, H<sub>2</sub>O + HCN, H<sub>2</sub>O + CH<sub>3</sub>OH, H<sub>2</sub>CO + CO.

                                The dependencies of cross sections on the energy difference between initial and final states of the 
                                colliding partners indicate a single-exponential behavior near &Delta;E = 0 regime, while a 
                                double-exponential behavior over the entire range of &Delta;E. This observation remain valid for 
                                a very large deviation of &Delta;E on both excitation (&Delta;E >0) and quenching (&Delta;E < 0) wings. 
                                Additionally, it is also observed that the variation of cross sections changes by several orders of 
                                magnitude as the energy difference &Delta;E increases. In this project, our focus is to exploit this 
                                exponential nature of the data depending on the &Delta;E and use that for our advantage as a selection 
                                criteria for preparing the training data set and then build the MLP model. The whole set of the available 
                                data is divided into three segments based off of only the energy difference between initial and final 
                                state (&Delta;E). To compose our training data set, we included cross sections for those transitions where 
                                the energy difference (&Delta;E) between initial and final levels of H<sub>2</sub>O + H<sub>2</sub>O 
                                molecules lies within a specific value, say <em>E</em><sub>cut</sub> for each collision energy 
                                (<em>E<sub>c</sub></em>). The validation data set is created by taking cross sections for all those 
                                transitions where the energy difference &Delta;E is between the previous value and a smaller addition to 
                                the value of <em>E</em><sub>cut</sub> (i.e., <em>E</em><sub>cut</sub> + &delta;<em>E</em><sub>cut</sub>).
                                And, finally, corss sections for all the remaining transitions are used as the testing data set.

                                In general, the idea is that the training data set consists of all cross section values for which the 
                                energy difference of the transition lies within a certain range, and another additional smaller range of 
                                energy difference would serve as a validation data set. Finally, all the cross sections for the remaining 
                                transitions are taken as the test data set. In this work, multiple values of <em>E</em><sub>cut</sub> is 
                                tested for our MLP modelling to optimize the computational efficiency and accuracy of our MLP model.
                                Each of our data set has thirteen features for our multilayer perceptron (MLP) modeling: rotational 
                                quantum numbers of initial and final states of the first water molecule 
                                (<em>j<sub>1</sub></em> <em>k<sub>a<sub>1</sub></sub></em> <em>k<sub>c<sub>1</sub></sub></em>,
                                <em>j'<sub>1</sub></em> <em>k'<sub>a<sub>1</sub></sub></em> <em>k'<sub>c<sub>1</sub></sub></em>), and the 
                                second water molecule
                                (<em>j<sub>2</sub></em> <em>k<sub>a<sub>2</sub></sub></em> <em>k<sub>c<sub>2</sub></sub></em>,
                                <em>j'<sub>2</sub></em> <em>k'<sub>a<sub>2</sub></sub></em> <em>k'<sub>c<sub>2</sub></sub></em>), and
                                energy difference between initial and final states of the molecular system, &Delta;E.

                                Once the data set is finalized, we started building our MLP model using neural-network. Our MLP model is 
                                composed of one input layer with thirteen neurons corresponding to each features of our data set. Then we 
                                have five hidden layers with each having 128 neurons. The number of hidden layers and number of neurons in 
                                each layer was found through manual search and decided based on the best performance of the model. In the 
                                end, there is one output layer with a single neuron corresponding to the cross section.

                                At this point, we are ready to compare the TACS computed using individual state-to-state transition 
                                cross sections between the actual MQCT data and the MLP model predicted data. We looked into an 
                                intermedite range of the rotational temperature <em>T</em> = 300 K, corresponding to room temperature. 
                                Six different values of collision energies of <em>E</em><sub>c</sub> = 133, 200, 267, 400, 533, and 708 
                                cm<sup>-1</sup> are computed separately and compared for each of the collision energies between the actual
                                MQCT data vs. the MLP model computed data. The transitions between para-H<sub>2</sub>O molecules and 
                                ortho-H<sub>2</sub>O molecules are also separately tested. The agreement is found to be excellent overall.
                                Some differences are seen when the value of TACS become relatively smaller.

                        One of the major interest of scientists in chemistry is to understand reactions better. When we look at a reaction
                        from a microscopic level, a reaction is nothing but a form of molecular scattering. Therefore, reactive scateering
                        is crucial to get more insight into chemical reaction. Studies of gas phase elementary reactions are at the forefront
                        of the chemical reactions being more managable to conduct experiments. However, getting more insight of a reaction at
                        quantum level is rather challanging. For example, at around room temperature (300 K), molecules occupy a 
                        significant number of rovibrational levels, which lead to the experimental observations being an averaged effect. As we
                        move to lower temperatures (about 10 K), only the first few rovibrational levels get occupied and hence, it involves only a few 
                        partial waves. In the ultracold regime (micro-kelvin and below), only one or first few initial low-lying partial 
                        waves are associated with collision allowing complete control of the colliding partners. Unraveling insights on 
                        chemical reactions and molecular interactions at fundamental quantum level advances the research of the molecular 
                        cooling and trapping technologies. It also has numerous applications to quantum sensing, ultracold chemistry, 
                        quantum computing, and quantum information processing.

                        Due to the strong interaction potential, alkali metals have been especially interesting to researchers in this field.
                        For example, a recent study was conducted by our group in the past for the reaction of 
                        <br> Li + LiNa &rarr; Li<sub>2</sub> + Na.
                        <br> There have been much progress made in the scientific community using litium dimers (Li<sub>2</sub>), but the
                        lithium trimers have not been explored much. My goal for this project is to study reaction of lithium trimer tigether
                        with isotopic substitution.

                    Astronomers need rate-coefficients of inelastic collisions of molecules to interpret the spectroscopic data 
                    obtained by various state-of-the-art observatories, like Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) radio telescope, 
                    Spitzer space telescope and, recently, James Webb space telescope (JWST). However, computing these rate-coefficients 
                    accurately using quantum mechanics for collisions of polyatomic molecules, such as H<sub>2</sub>O+H<sub>2</sub>O, 
                    is impossible.

                <p style="text-indent: 4em;">
                    We performed new calculations of collision cross sections for state-to-state transitions between the rotational states 
                    in an H<sub>2</sub>O+H<sub>2</sub>O system, which are used to generate a new database of collisional rate coefficients 
                    for cometary and planetary applications. Calculations were carried out using a mixed quantum-classical theory (MQCT) 
                    approach that is implemented in the code MQCT. The large basis set of rotational states used in these calculations 
                    permits us to predict thermally averaged cross sections for 441 transitions in para- and ortho-H<sub>2</sub>O in a broad range 
                    of temperatures.

                    It is found that all state-to-state transitions in the H<sub>2</sub>O+H<sub>2</sub>O system split into two 
                    well-defined groups, one with higher cross-section values and lower energy transfer, which corresponds to the 
                    dipole-dipole driven processes. The other group has smaller cross sections and higher energy transfer, driven by 
                    higher-order interaction terms. We present a detailed analysis of the theoretical error bars, and we symmetrized 
                    the state-to-state transition matrixes to ensure that excitation and quenching processes for each transition satisfy 
                    the principle of microscopic reversibility. We also compare our results with other data available from the literature 
                    for H<sub>2</sub>O+H<sub>2</sub>O collisions.

                    A two-temperature model was employed that assumed that although there is no equilibrium between all possible degrees of 
                    freedom in the system, the translational and rotational degrees of freedom can be expected to achieve their own equilibria 
                    independently, and that they can be approximately characterized by Boltzmann distributions at two different temperatures, 
                    <em>T<sub>kin</sub></em> and <em>T<sub>rot</sub></em>. Upon introducing our new parameterization of the collisional rates, 
                    taking into account their dependence on both <em>T<sub>kin</sub></em> and <em>T<sub>rot</sub></em>, we find a change of up 
                    to 20% in the H<sub>2</sub>O rotational level populations for both ortho and para-H<sub>2</sub>O for the part of the 
                    cometary coma where the nonequilibrium regime occurs. This research was doen in collaboration with

                    A computationally affordable methodology is developed to predict cross sections and rate coffcients for 
                    collisional quenching and excitation of large molecules in space, such as PAHs using mixed quantum/classical theory (MQCT).
                    To boost the numerical performance even further, a decoupling scheme for the equations of motion and a Monte Carlo
                    sampling of the initial conditions are implemented. The method is applied to compute cross sections for 
                    rotational excitation and quenching of a benzene molecule (C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>6</sub>) by collisions with He atoms in a broad range of energies, 
                    using a very large basis set of rotational eigenstates up to <em>j</em> = 60, and close to one million nonzero matrix elements 
                    for state-to-state transitions. The properties of collision cross sections for C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>6</sub> + He are reported and discussed.
                    The accuracy of the approximations is rigorously tested and is found to be suitable for astrophysical/astrochemical

                    Inelastic molecular collisions represent a fundamental chemical and physical process, in which the energetically 
                    excited molecule in a bath gas exchanges its internal energy with quenchers and finally gets stabilized. This process 
                    describes energy transfer between an energetically excited molecule colliding with a quencher, which involves 
                    all degrees of freedom, i.e., rotational, vibrational and translational. The energy transfer during an inelastic 
                    molecular collusion is important in many chemical phenomena like recombination reactions, reactivity of metastable 
                    intermediates, enthalpy released by chemical bonds, photochemistry, astrochemistry, atmospheric chemistry, 
                    in combustion, or in the reaction of ultracold temperature. If the rates of the state-to-state energy transfer 
                    processes are known, then many quantitatively accurate predictions about the course of collision dynamics, and about 
                    its final state, can be made.
                </p>

                <p><strong>Drawbacks of classical methods to study molecular scattering:</strong></p>

                <p style="text-indent: 4em;">
                    Study of this process with classical trajectory method is sometimes implemented to understand the dynamics of 
                    collisional energy transfer. But the classical dynamics does not have any quantization of states, so it cannot provide 
                    any state specific details of energy transfer process. It provides only a rough picture. People employ the classical 
                    method because it is computationally affordable. However, in some cases, it has other problems as well. The most important 
                    issue is the leakage of the vibrational zero-point energy. This could significantly change the collision dynamics near the 
                    dissociation threshold. Although, classical trajectory can describe the Feshbach resonance when two molecules are trapped 
                    together by exchange of translational and internal (rotational and vibrational) energy. But it cannot describe shape resonance 
                    populated by tunneling because tunneling is a quantum mechanical phenomenon. It lacks quantization of energy which is 
                    also problematic for the energy transfer process. Moreover, classical method does not have any symmetry effect. It 
                    cannot restrict the process from transferring energy to the states that are forbidden by selection rules of quantum 
                    mechanics. Therefore, all the state-to-state transitions are allowed in this method which is physically incorrect. 
                    It has been observed that quantum symmetry plays an important role in the energy transfer process in the context of 
                    isotope effect, which classical trajectory method cannot describe.
                </p>

                <p><strong>Why not full quantum methods?</strong></p>

                <p style="text-indent: 4em;">
                    The full quantum method to study the energy transfer is another approach, but it is computationally very demanding. 
                    The collision processes of two colliding partners involve not only the state-to-state transition for the vibrational 
                    degrees of freedom, but also the rotational states. The vibrational states need to be determined for different values 
                    of <em>J</em>, the angular momentum quantum number. So basically, the size of the matrix over the number of the 
                    coupled equations depends on the number of states in the system accessed during the collision process. In practice, 
                    it can be easily implemented for those cases when the number of states is relatively small, such as light molecules 
                    H<sub>2</sub>, OH, NH and at low collision energies. When molecules become heavier, such as S<sub>2</sub>, CO, 
                    CH<sub>3</sub>COOH, H<sub>2</sub>O and the collision energy is relatively higher, like the room temperature and above, 
                    then this is problematic. This leads to huge number of vibrational and rotational states, large size of the 
                    state-to-state transition matrix and numerically expensive computation time. As a result, the full quantum method 
                    become unaffordable.
                </p>

                <p><strong>Solution: Mixed Quantum/Classical Theory (MQCT)</strong></p>

                <p style="text-indent: 4em;">
                    We developed an alternative method to describe the molecular energy transfer process. It is a mixed methodology of 
                    both classical mechanics and quantum mechanics. It takes advantage of the fact that the relative motion of the 
                    collision process of two colliding partners can be treated classical mechanically in most cases. However, in order to 
                    stop zero-point energy leakage, we have to treat the vibrational degrees of freedom quantum mechanically. Our 
                    methodology, the mixed quantum/classical theory (MQCT), treats internal degrees of freedom, such as vibration and/or 
                    rotations quantum mechanically, while the scattering is treated classically (translational motion). A significant 
                    speed up of this approach is achieved by classical-trajectory treatment of the scattering process that uses numerically 
                    inexpensive Newtonian mechanics, instead of the Schrodinger equation. Further computational advantage is due to the 
                    intrinsic massive parallelism of the MQCT approach, in which different trajectories are independent and can be propagated 
                    simultaneously using different processors, without any message passing. The resultant computational gain is very substantial, 
                    enabling inelastic scattering calculations for larger molecules and at higher collision energies, compared to the standard 
                    full-quantum approach.
                </p>

                <p style="text-indent: 4em;">
                    A user-ready code, named "MQCT", has also been developed and made available to the community, that can be employed for 
                    efficient calculations of rotationally inelastic scattering of any two molecules, and for some rotationally-vibrationally 
                    inelastic scattering calculations. We want to stress again that, to our best knowledge, no other code can do the inelastic 
                    scattering calculations of two general asymmetric top rotors. Potential users of the code are among the members of 
                    astrophysics community, atmospheric chemists and, of course, physical chemists. Our code is written in FORTRAN and 
                    is parallelized using MPI. Efficiency of massively parallel calculations (scaling) is explored using the example of 
                    water + water rotationally inelastic scattering. Several typical input files are given for calculations on 
                    H<sub>2</sub>O + He, H<sub>2</sub>O + H<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>O + H<sub>2</sub>O systems, as examples. 
                    Users will find that MQCT calculations are very easy to set up and run since many parameters are set to reasonable default values.

                <p style="text-indent: 4em;">
                    Although the mixed quantum/classical treatment is more affordable than the full quantum treatment, there are still 
                    molecular systems and collision conditions where even the MQCT calculations become computationally demanding. 
                    Let us consider the H<sub>2</sub>O + H<sub>2</sub> system covered in this paper. Assume that, in the basis for 
                    para-H<sub>2</sub>O molecule, we want to include the lowest 45 rotational states with the upper state <em>j</em><sub>1</sub>= 8 
                    at 1442.095 cm<sup>-1</sup> (<em>k</em><sub>a</sub>= 6, <em>k</em><sub>c</sub>= 2) and the largest value of 
                    <em>j</em><sub>1</sub>= 11 at 1332.166 cm<sup>-1</sup> (<em>k</em><sub>a</sub>= 1, <em>k</em><sub>c</sub>= 11),
                    whereas for the para-H<sub>2</sub>, we want to include two rotational states with the upper state <em>j</em><sub>2</sub> = 2 at
                    365.118 cm<sup>-1</sup>. This gives us 90 energetically non-degenerate asymptotic rotational states overall in the 
                    basis for the H<sub>2</sub>O + H<sub>2</sub> system. In the example above, the largest value of the total molecular 
                    angular momentum is <em>j</em><sub>12</sub>= 13, and there are 264 channels overall. Within each molecular channel, there are 2<em>j</em><sub>12</sub> + 1 
                    projection states with different values of <em>m</em>. Altogether, this gives 3486 unique quantum states in the basis
                    and a huge state-to-state transition matrix. In the MQCT code,31 zero matrix elements are identified and excluded, but 
                    still, for the example above, the number of unique non-zero matrix elements included  is 336 595, which represents a 
                    numerical challenge since the MQCT equations of motion inlcudes a triple sum and this summations need to be re-computed 
                    at each time step (several times) along each trajectory. 
                </p>

                <p style="text-indent: 4em;">
                    It is clear that the largest contributions to the equations of motion will normally come from the most populated 
                    states, those with larger values of probability amplitudes. For many molecular systems and many collision conditions, 
                    the inelastic transition probabilities are relatively small, and thus the survival probability (in the initial channel)
                    is dominant. Therefore, one simple way to truncate the sum in equations of motion is to retain only the states of the 
                    initial channel. This can include all the degenerate <em>m</em> states since the number of such states within one 
                    channel is usually manageable, 2<em>j</em><sub>12</sub> + 1. With this choice, the MQCT trajectories will be driven 
                    by the potential energy surface associated with one quantum channel only (the initial channel), rather than by the 
                    average Ehrenfest potential. Such trajectories are not sensitive to excitation or quenching of the initial state and, 
                    strictly speaking, are not the mean-field trajectories anymore. These are adiabatic trajectories, which suggests the
                    name AT-MQCT for this approximation.
                </p>

                <p style="text-indent: 4em;">
                    The adiabatic trajectory approximation is specific to the time-dependent mixed quantum/classical theory, and thus it 
                    does not have any direct quantum analogue to our best knowledge. In this method, the classical and quantum equations 
                    of motion are decoupled in a sense by conducting MQCT calculations in two consecutive steps. During the first step, 
                    the molecular basis size is restricted to the degenerate states of the initial rotational channel only (with different 
                    projections of the molecular angular momentum). This information is recorded and used during the second run to 
                    propagate the quantum equations of motion along this pre-computed adiabatic path. The Coriolis-like coupling terms 
                    are included in both steps of such calculations, which preserves an important physical effect in contrast to the 
                    coupled-states (CS) approximation where it is entirely neglected.

                <p style="text-indent: 4em;">
                    In practice, this can be implemented as follows:

                    <li>
                        In the first run, propagate all MQCT equations of motion rigorously coupled as before but using an adiabatic basis
                        that includes only 2<em>j</em><sub>12</sub> + 1 states (labeled by <em>m</em>) of the initial quantum channel. 
                        Since the basis is small, such MQCT calculations would be trivial for any molecular system without any other 
                        approximations. The existing MQCT code can be used without modifications. These would be adiabatic MQCT calculations 
                        since no rotational excitation or quenching of the internal molecular states is possible within such a basis, but 
                        the goal is to record the trajectory data as a function of time and to use this information during the second run.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        In the second run, the basis is increased to the desired size in order to describe all the state-to-state 
                        excitation and quenching transitions (e.g., 90 states in the H<sub>2</sub>O + H<sub>2</sub> example above), 
                        but now only the quantum system of coupled equations is propagated in time to determine the evolution of 
                        probability amplitudes. The value of classical variables for the state-to-state transition matrix and the Coriolis 
                        coupling are "borrowed" from the adiabatic trajectory data saved during the first run (e.g., using a 1D spline along 
                        the trajectory, which is a computationally cheap trick).
                    </li>

                    This method was applied to a real system of H<sub>2</sub>O + H<sub>2</sub>, and it was found that a very significant 
                    acceleration, by two orders of magnitude, is obtained at high collision energies. The results of the approximate 
                    propagation scheme are still rather accurate, as determined by comparison against more rigorous CC-MQCT calculations 
                    in which the quantum and classical equations of motion are propagated together in a coupled fashion but also against 
                    the full-quantum CC calculations from the literature (using the same potential energy surface).

                    In this project, we expand on calculations of differential cross sections using MQCT and propose solution to the 
                    problem encountered in the past. Namely, the previous calculations of differential (over scattering angle) 
                    cross sections for the elastic channel of the N<sub>2</sub> + Na system, for ground rotational state of the nitrogen 
                    molecule, <em>j</em> = 0 was reported before. In the quantum scattering regime (forward scattering) we found excellent
                    agreement between our MQCT results and the full-quantum results of Dalgarno and co-workers for the same system. But 
                    in the backward scattering regime the results of MQCT were incorrect (noisy), which at that time was tentatively 
                    attributed to numerical issues.
                </p>

                <p style="text-indent: 4em;">
                    It is found that the mixed quantum/classical theory (MQCT) for the description of molecular scattering is considerably 
                    improved by using integer values of orbital angular momentum <em>l</em>, just like in quantum theory, instead of treating it as 
                    a continuous classical variable related to the impact parameter. This conclusion is justified by the excellent 
                    accuracy of the modified theory for prediction of the diferential cross sections, at various values of collision energy 
                    and in both forward and backward scattering regimes. This approach requires fewer trajectories, compared to the random 
                    Monte Carlo sampling, and the only convergence parameter is <em>l</em><sub>max</sub> (maximum orbital angular momentum) 
                    similar to <em>J</em><sub>max</sub> in the full quantum theory (maximum total angular momentum).
                </p>

                <p style="text-indent: 4em;">
                    Differential cross sections for inelastic scattering were reported here for the first time, but only for the initial 
                    rotational level <em>j</em> = 0. More insight was also obtained in how, within the MQCT framework, phase information 
                    can be utilized to describe interference between different values of <em>l</em>, and how the phase can be employed to 
                    determine differential and elastic integral scattering cross sections. These observables represent quantum properties 
                    of the system, since both rely on interference between different values of <em>l</em>. Phase appears to be a dominant 
                    factor in the elastic scattering cross section.

                <strong><span style="color: blue;">Molecular Dynamics simulation of a &lambda;-protein in presence of a surfactant:</span></strong>

                <p style="text-indent: 4em;">
                    Proteins are one of the major building blocks of our body. Their folded structure and spatial orientaion in our body 
                    plays a crucial role in doing their jobs. But often times, proteins in our body are exposed to stressful environments
                    due to presence of external bodies, such as medicine, environmental pollutants, and natural substances. In such circamstances,
                    protein can unfold or "denature" which affects the performance of the proteins. One such external substance is surfactant,
                    which is soap-like molecules found in detergant or cosmetics and capable to denature proteins. Surfactants have both hydrophillic 
                    and hydrophobic parts present in their molecular structure which helps them to stick to a protien and damage the proten's 
                    structural integrity.
                </p>

                <p style="text-indent: 4em;">
                    In our research, our choice of surfactant is dodine which is normally used as fungicide. In general, most surfactants or 
                    other chemical denaturants, like urea or guanidinium chloride, that can unfold a protein requires higher concentration 
                    to be effective. However, dodine is much more potent and is highly effective in very small doses. Dodine can denature 
                    proteins even at a low concentration, such as milimolar concentration. Getting more insight into the protein-surfactant 
                    interaction have a braod field of application in the research of drug delivery, pharmaceuticals, protein storage, 
                    biotechnology processes, and even in food science.

                <strong><span style="color: blue;">Energy harvesting by turning mechanical vibrations into power:</span></strong>

                <p style="text-indent: 4em;">
                    Modern human life is surrounded by tiny electronic devices or better known as "gadgets", 
                such as medical implants, wireless sensors, and remote monitoring systems, which are usually powered by batteries.
                The inevitable with battery technology is that it's bound to depletion as the power cycles through it and eventually going to reach the end of life of the battery.
                The traditional batteries are very challenging, often impossible, to replace once the devices are in use. Therefore, 
                there is a growing need for an alternative technology that can operate without needing frequent battery replacements.
                This motivated scientists in energy harvesting, which is finding ways to store energy using natural sources from the environment,
                such as light, heat, or vibrations, and convert it into usable electricity. Among these, vibration-based energy harvesting has been the most interesting to sceintists
                due to the abundaces of vibrations in our surroundings: such as in moving vehicles, working machines, in atmospheres, even in our human body.
                </p>

                    <p style="text-indent: 4em;">
                        In our research, we investigated how we can capture energy from simple vibrations (like those from walking, machines, or even wind) and 
                        turn it into usable electricity. We built numerical simulation by modelling devices called vibration energy harvesters, 
                        which uses piezoelectric materials. A main property of the piezoelectric materials is that it can generate voltage when the material is bent or 
                        stretched. It is also compact and thus quite efficient for small-scale devices.
                        Our primary focus was on understanding the effect of different initial conditions of our model on the efficiency by which it captures energy 
                        from its surroundings.
